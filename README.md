# Unit 19: Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview

This class will begin our exploration of machine learning, focusing on supervised machine learning models. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you'll be able to: 

* Explain how machine learning algorithms are used in data analytics.

* Create training and testing sets from a specified dataset.

* Implement linear and logistic regressions by using scikit-learn.

* Create confusion matrixes for classification outputs.

* Calculate and apply fundamental classification algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN).

* Quantify and evaluate classification models by using confusion matrixes.

* Implement one-hot encoding in Pandas, and scaling and normalization with scikit-learn.

* Calculate and apply bagging and boosting methods to create and use ensemble algorithms.

* Describe regularization parameters for regressions, and select appropriate parameters for a given problem.

* Use Random Forests and LASSO regressions to assist in the feature selection process.
